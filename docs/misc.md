## Keyboard shortcuts

It's possible to assign keybindings for often performed actions. Some of the most useful:

- `commands.openAsQuickPick` - show all commands in Quick Pick
- `commands.tree.focus` - focus the main Tree View

## Codicons

To quickly find an icon (for Tree View or Status Bar) there's an extension that can show all codicons (with preview) and insert picked id into the editor:
