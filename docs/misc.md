## Keyboard shortcuts

It's possible to assign keybindings for often performed actions. Some of the most useful:

- `commands.openAsQuickPick` - show all commands in Quick Pick
- `commands.tree.focus` - focus the main Tree View

## Running sequence without adding it to `settings.json`

If the only purpose for a command sequence is to run it from a keybinding, then it might be easier to just run it from a `keybindings.json` file directly:

```js
{
    "key": "ctrl+shift+9",
    "command": "commands.run",
    "args": [
        "editor.action.toggleMinimap",
        "workbench.action.toggleSidebarVisibility"
    ]
}
```

## Codicons

To quickly find an icon (for Tree View or Status Bar) there's an extension that can show all codicons (with preview) and insert picked id into the editor:
